                I have always had an interest in computer technologies but never indulged myself into it seriously until the outburst of the Covid-19 Pandemic. While stuck at home, left without a job, I did a research on different fields of computer programming and got really interested in Fron-End web development. What hooked me to it was that one can immediately see the results of his work, represented in a visual way and also the fact that there is design involved in it. Later on I understood that a front-end developer is actually not a designer but is responsible for connecting the business logic behind a web application with the visual representation prepared and provided by a digital designer. I started messing around with HTMl and CSS and discovered the great possibilities for creating dynamic web content. Naturally I started looking for more information about technologies required to become a front-end developer, which led me to the JavaScript technological stack and to the SoftUni JavaScript Program which I enrolled. Since September 2020 I have been learning the ins and outs of front-end development and discovered a vast universe of knowledge to explore. The more things I learned, the more new things came up to be learned and it is a never ending process. What I miss is the experience in a real production environment.
